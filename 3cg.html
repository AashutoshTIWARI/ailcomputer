    <H2>Generally performed by tribal groups like Gonds, Baigas, and Oraons in Chhattisgarh.

        This dance form marks the end of the rainy season and the advent of spring.
        
        Both men and women participate in the dance following a lead singer.
        
        The unexplored beauty of the region is complete without the camaraderie of tribal popular culture.</H2>
