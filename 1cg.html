    <h3>Chhattisgarh is one of the ancient states of India.

        Chhattisgarh borders associated with the states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana.
        
        The Chhattisgarhi culture is immersed in varieties of dance forms, mainly due to the number of tribes residing in the vast expanse of the state.
        
        The stateâ€™s tribal population has developed many native indigenous folk performances of their cultural beliefs.
        
        Most of the Chhattisgarh folk dance forms are performed as part of rituals, performed in reverence for the gods or denoting the change of seasons.
        
        Special costumes and accessories are made for such dance forms and the fast movements combined with perfect timing will leave you mesmerized.
