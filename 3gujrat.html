            This name definitely rings a bell. The rhythmic and gracious dance movements, the synchronised dancing and an energy of excitement is all what makes this dance form one of the most widely admired. The dance is dedicated to goddess Amba and is done on concentric circles with the central focus being the idol or an image of the goddess. The hand clapping and finger snapping is all a part of the process and the best part is dressing up for this. Women wear colourful and designer Ghaghra Choli with equally elaborate jewellery sets consisting of nose rings, bangles, earrings, anklets and many other which puts the whole look together in one place.
