<h2>
The name Bhavai is derived from the word bhava which translates into feelings or emotions. This dance is presented in the form of a classical folk gujaratis drama which takes place in various villages and temple complexes, especially by the professional communities of the indigenous tribes like the bhojakas, the taragalas and some other tribes from north Gujarat. This dramatic performance takes place and goes on for an entire night and without the help of any sort of certain stage equipment. The main feature of this representation is the depiction of various issues in the social life of different communities and the absence of women in this which mean that the male artists have to perform the part of the women as well.
