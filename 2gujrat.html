<h2>
Deemed for being one of the most iconic and popular dance forms of Gujarat this fun dance is not just famous in Gujarat but has also gathered international attention. Typically, this rhythmic dance involves 2 sticks and the raas is in the form of a Raas Leela. Being the land of lord Krishna, this dance form is dedicated to the childhood dance he used to do which was Raas Leela and takes place in concentric circles as well. One can see this elaborate celebration of enthusiastic and zealous dance during the auspicious time of Navratri. The best raas dancers here in these regions are considered to be the Kathiawari and the folks from the Saurashtra Region.
