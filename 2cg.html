    <h2>The Chhattisgarh dance form is performed by boys after the harvest season.

        This stick dance involves children who move in various styles while tapping their sticks against the stick of the person next to them.
        
        Villagers give paddy to people who participate in the dance as a sign of gratitude.
        
        The climax of this unique dance form is generally a snake dance!</h2>
